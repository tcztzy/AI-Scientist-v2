# Audit Checklist

Use this checklist after extraction to review each figure.

## Caption alignment
- Does the caption accurately describe what the figure shows?
- Does the caption contain a concise takeaway, not just setup?
- Are axis labels, legend entries, and units consistent with the caption?

## Main-text integration (figrefs)
- Does the main text reference the figure where needed?
- Do figrefs explain why the figure matters (not just "see Figure X")?
- Are there missing references for important figures?

## Information density and redundancy
- Is the figure too sparse to justify space in the main text?
- Could it be combined with another figure as subplots?
- Does it duplicate another figure (same story, different rendering)?

## Figure quality
- Readability at paper scale (font sizes, line widths, legend placement).
- Clear baselines and comparisons.
- Avoid misleading scales or cropped axes unless justified.

## Decision
- Keep in main text / move to appendix / merge / remove.
