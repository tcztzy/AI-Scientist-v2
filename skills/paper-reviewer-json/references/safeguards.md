# Safeguards

## Confidentiality
- Treat the paper as private unless the user says it is public.
- Do not upload the PDF or extracted text to external services without explicit user request.

## Factuality
- Keep all critiques grounded in the provided text.
- If the paper omits details, ask questions instead of assuming.

## Plagiarism / quoting
- Avoid long verbatim excerpts.
- Prefer paraphrases and short quotes only when necessary.

## AI-use disclosure (if applicable)
- If your workflow uses tools or code with mandatory AI-use disclosure requirements (e.g., AI-Scientist-v2), comply with that license and with your venue's policies when submitting manuscripts.
