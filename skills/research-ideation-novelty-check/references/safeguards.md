# Safeguards

## Network / privacy
- `scripts/s2_search.py` is **offline by default**. Only use `--online` after user confirmation.
- Never paste API keys into chat logs. If needed, read from an environment variable (e.g., `S2_API_KEY`).

## Novelty claims
- Semantic Scholar search is a *sanity-check*, not a proof of novelty.
- Record your query strings and the date/time of the search in your notes (see `references/novelty-check.md`).

## AI-use disclosure (if applicable)
- If your workflow uses tools or code with mandatory AI-use disclosure requirements (e.g., AI-Scientist-v2), comply with that license and with your venue's policies when submitting manuscripts.
